== Satplan License

[License snippet reproduced from Satplan's README.txt]

Some solvers may have licenses which prohibit us from re-distributing binaries.
 In these cases, notes will exist here on what you will need to do to get that
 solver on your machine so that satplan can use it.
 satplan itself can be used freely.  Its use is only restricted by the licenses
 of the underlying solvers called by satplan that you specify.

-One such solver is BerkMin561.  This is an excellent solver and it is 
 recommended that you do the following, assuming you will not be using satplan
 beyond the license agreement for BerMin561:
 -visit http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kenmcmil/smv/dld2.html
 -review the license agreement.  If you agree, then provide the necessary
  information and download the binary.
 -run the BerkMin561 program once *directly* (not through satplan) and, again,
  assuming you do agree, agree to the license agreement.  Now a file 
  license.txt will be constructed.
 -move license.txt and the binary to the include/bin/ subdirectory.  Make sure
  the binary is named: berkmin61-linux.  If not, then rename it.  That's it.

 Note: BerkMin561 is "compiled-into" satplan.  satplan is ready to call the
       binary if it exists.  If the binary does not exist on your system,
       there is no problem.  In this case, if you choose berkmin561 as your
       solver, satplan will tell you that the solver does not exist.  If you
       do not specify berkmin561, satplan will run as expected, with the 
       chosen solver or the default solver if unspecified.
